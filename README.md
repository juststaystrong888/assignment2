A person wishes to track their total calorie intake. This total is affected by two things: eating and walking. In addition, they have decided to follow a meal plan, offering a finite selection of meals which they can consume.

Create a person and print their total number of calories.
Use the list of meals from the bottom of the page to complete the following tasks (note that you must only create the meals necessary for the question):
Make the person eat the meal with the lowest calories. Then, print the total calories in this meal and print the new total calories of the person.
Make the person eat the meal with 1000 calories. Then, print the total calories in this meal and print the new total calories of the person.
Make the person eat the meal with the highest calories. Then, print the total calories in this meal and print the new total calories of the person.
Finally, make your person go for a walk until their total calorie intake reaches 2000. This will require your person to walk for a certain number of minutes, which you must determine outside of the program. After the walk, print this number of minutes.
